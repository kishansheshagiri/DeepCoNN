 Based on visualizations we observed that Yelp essentially has two classes of users: 
    class 1 - uses Yelp purely to look for food/entertainment but do not engage in the social networking much. 
    class 2 - exhibits the power law, has many friends, and treats yelp as a social network so mainly relying on their network of friends to recommend them Restaurants, along with other interactions.

Further, We want to extend this Heterogeneous Information Network and using the edge weight relations to modify few parameters in the Loss Function.
